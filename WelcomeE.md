## 👋 About Me

I’m a data-driven professional with a background in **Analytical Chemistry** and formal training in **Data Science**. I thrive at the intersection of analytics, modeling, and engineering—where clean data meets intelligent systems.

My career began in scientific research, where I contributed to projects involving **ocean acidification**, **turbidity monitoring**, **water nutrient profiling**, and **soil analysis** through field work and laboratory analysis at the **Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI)**. These experiences developed my core strengths in experimental design, data collection, and statistical interpretation.

I transitioned into tech through **Moringa School's Data Science Bootcamp**, and since then, I’ve built a cross-functional portfolio across data cleaning, statistical modeling, machine learning pipelines, optimization problems, and production-ready APIs.

Whether it’s predicting flight delays, modeling real estate prices, optimizing electric vehicle routes, or enabling humanitarian response with data dashboards, I bring a unique blend of **analytical rigor, engineering practicality, and domain understanding**.

I am currently preparing to begin a **Master’s in Data Science**, further deepening my capabilities in machine learning, distributed systems, and real-world data infrastructure design.
